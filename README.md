# Ancient dental calculus from Oceania

This repository is for keeping the data processing and analysis of ancient dental calculus samples
from populations in Oceania. This includes sequencing statistics, taxonomic, and 
functional analyses. These samples are compared within each other using the various 
metadata categories collected (island, age, others), and are compared to published 
ancient dental calculus from across the globe spanning a similar time period.


## Overview about the repository

* `02-Scripts.backup`: scripts for sample processing and analysis
* `05-Documentation.backup`: results from the data analysis that can stand alone,
  meaning they aren't strictly used as input for another step
* `06-publication`: publicaiton-asscociated files for figures and tables
