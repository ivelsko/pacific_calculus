###Notes for analysis of Pacific calculus - Zandra FagernÃ¤s

2018-09-22
All raw data symlinked to project folder, separated into folders per sample.
EAGER with HG19, no map quality filter. 
	NOTE: L1 R1 of S30 is broken, ends suddenly. S30 cannot be processed for now!
	Unmapped reads extracted.
	FastQC run on all files and damage patterns created.
All unmapped reads (fatsq.gz files) are symlinked to data/non_human.
Started MALT-run against fullNT database.

EAGER with HG19 and map quality filter of 37 (output in eager_human_mapqual37).
EAGER with Pseudopropionibacterium propionicum and map quality filter of 37 (output in eager_PsePro_mapqual37).
MALT run finished.

Ran MaltEx and postprocessing (part of HOPS) with 95% identity threshold with list of all eukaryotes and viruses+pathogens.

2018-10-02
Generated cumulative frequency plots.
Mapped to Silva 16S database with bwa aln and samtools (script run_mapping.sh)

2018-10-04
Ran 16s closed-reference clustering in QIIME according to James' Sourcetracker tutorial (script run_qiime.sh). 
	Note: Permissions need to be changed on outdir for some reason (775)
Prepared everything necessary for running Sourcetracker.

2018-10-10
Re-ran Sourcetracker with new set of sources, which include bone and sediment
	Note: There is always a ' in the otu table, which needs to be manually removed for Sourcetracker to run
Created barcharts in R to replace the piechart that are the default output in Sourcetracker
Filtered away samples with >70% skin+sediment+bone (default from James is 50%, but this removes 21 samples)
